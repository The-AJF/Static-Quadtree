# Tester.java
A windowed application to thoroughly test the functionality of Quadtree.java, AABB.java. Tester.java will create a number of AABBs with random values and continuously move them around the screen while updating the quadtree and refreshing the screen. The simulator will allow you to:
- add/remove AABBs
- grow/shrink AABBs
- increase/decrease the tree depth
- make the quadtree square or rectangular

## usage:
1. place in the same directory as Quadtree.java, AABB.java
2. compile Tester.java
3. run
